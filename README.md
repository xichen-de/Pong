# WPF Pong Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) in C#. The game allows one player to control a paddle on the left side of the screen using the `W` and `S` keys, while the other player is controlled by the computer. The goal of the game is to hit the ball with the paddle and prevent it from crossing over to the opponent's side.

## Requirements

To run this game, you will need:

- Microsoft Visual Studio with support for C# and WPF development
- .NET Framework 6.0 or later

## Installation

1. Clone or download the source code for the game.
2. Open the solution file (`Pong.sln`) in Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution by selecting "Build" > "Build Solution" from the menu bar.
4. Run the game by selecting "Debug" > "Start Debugging" from the menu bar, or by pressing `F5`.

## Gameplay

- Use the `W` and `S` keys to move the left paddle up and down.
- The right paddle is controlled by the computer and will move automatically to try to hit the ball.
- The game ends when one player scores 10 points or when the player chooses to quit.
- After the game is over, the player can choose to play again or quit.
